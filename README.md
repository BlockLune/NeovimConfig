# My NeoVim Config

This is my NeoVim config based on the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)'s [starter template](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BlockLune/NeovimConfig.git ~/.config/nvim
```

There are only two files changed.

Added some lines in `init.lua`, and create the dir `./lua/user/` which includes the `keymaps.lua`.
